Cute College Girl
=================
I've built this in early 2007 or maybe 2008 when all these infamous sites
like *hottestgirlsoffacebook.com* or *hottestgirlsofmyspace.com* where
rising and shining.

I thought, why not just crawl the [Cute College Girl of the Day](#) from
[CollegeHumor.com](#) and post it on my blog as a joke, obtaining pretty
much the same effect.

TODO
----
This was meant to be run as a cron-job every night, but it would be cool
to add XMLRPC support to it thus broadening the audience. (pretty much
all major CMSes have XMLRPC support built-in)
